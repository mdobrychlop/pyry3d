how to compile and run

	You need to have these installed on your computer to run optimized version:

		-swig (version 2.0 or newer)
		-python (version 2.5, 2.6 or 2.7)
		-cmake (version 2.8 or newer)

	Sometimes you will also have to install "python-dev" packages.

	Compilation is simple (here explained linux style):
		1. Enter Modules/Simul/cpp subdirectory in pyry3d directory
		2. run `cmake .`
		3. `make`
		4. run pyry3d 

	On all systems you have to use cmake to compile pyry's shared library.

	Note that _pyry3d_cpp.so library is not compatible with python3.

	If there are problems with cmake, make sure that it uses correct c++ compiler.
	If there are more than one compiler you may have to specify which one
	should be used by cmake (on Linux you have to set CXX variable to, for
	example, g++-4.7).

	Note that if you're running Pyry under Windows, you need to INSTALL (not only
	download) SWIG.
